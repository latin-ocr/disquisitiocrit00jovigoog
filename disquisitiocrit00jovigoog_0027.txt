week? Between Sabbaths und ιι week? The language is strangeiy
iopam, if thore is no differenee!

Where the “sabbath’' is found in Matt. xxviii. 1, the Greek
has the plural: and the word “week” stands for plural Sabbaths
in Matt. xxviii. 1; Mark xvi. 2; Luke xxiv. 1, aud John xx. 1.
Here, then, are five plural Sabbatha connected with the Lord’s
resurrection. well, he lay iu the grave the passover Sabbath on
Thursday, and the Yth-day Sabbath on Saturdoy; and this har-

had passed, and the spioes were bought on Fridoy, the same day
they were prepared, and the women rested on the 7th·doy Sabbath

passover Sabbath—John xix. 14—not of tho 7th·day Sabbath.
The next day wasa “high day ;'' a great Sabbath‚ that eame at
the great feast of unleavene'd bread. John xix. 31. A Sabbath
that came fifty-two times a year was not a great Sabbath. As
there were other preparation days, Christ was not necessarily eru-
oified on Friday—espeoially ‘hs he would thereby have forfeited
his claim to Divinity i Matt. xii. 38-40‚ and xxvii. 62-66.

rose at sunset, in order to make the full “three days and three
