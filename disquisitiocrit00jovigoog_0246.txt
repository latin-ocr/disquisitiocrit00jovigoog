carrrcenrnnrusn nrsqursrrron. 212

plural to aipuisy the sarnay os the Sabbathday‚ as Jn0. George

Rosenmiiller says on this text, the meaning is singulm, and

that fer several reasons. First, the Syriae interpreter, whom we
must suppose to have been perfeetly acquainted with the force
of that word, has rendered it hy sonanron (la), which isin the
singular number. Seeoudly, in verse the second ef the same '
chapter, the same day is mentioned in the singular, ἐν σαὸόάτῳ.

, Thirdly„in Luke (vi. 1.), the same fact is narrated‚ as in the eor·
responding passage of Matthew, and the noun Sabbath is put in

the singular ἐν σασόάτῳ,
