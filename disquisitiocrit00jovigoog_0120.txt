the Greek μετὰ or the Latin post, as when we say: atter the end of
&o many days, this seems to exclude the end itself ; newertheless it
not rarcly happens that it includes the end: much more frequently
however do the Latin and the Greek particles.’' Such being the

case, with reason do we conclude that the preposition μετὰ, even

when used with the accusative and denoting time, indicates both
the end and what is generally expressed by the particles ἐν,
μεταξύ, etc.

clo-As it manifestly appears from the point under discussion
that the preposition μετὰ, when endowed with the previously men·
tioned qualifications, significa both after and within ‚· the question
naturally arises: which of the two meanings does it claim in the
present controverted passage of Mark? We unhositatingly
answer within-and thus we prove our assertion: The Syriae prep-
osition LOMAD (13.) answers to εἰς, διὰ, in, ndhin. But the Syriae
interpreter 'of the N. T. renders μετὰ by nonan. Therefore, he
takes μετὰ for εἰς, διὰ ; and consequently μετὰ in the above quoted
passage cf Mark signifies narnia. That εἰς and διὰ answer tc the
preposition Louna), is obvious from the comparison of the follow-
ing passages of Holy Writ: Esdras (x. 8.) : nnhnh rur ath anu hat
oron, Syriac aarflnorflon (14.); LXX. Πᾶς ὅς ἄν μὴ ἔλθῃ εἰς.
τρεῖς ἡμέρας ; Vulgata, Omnis qni non venerit in cabaa diebos, and
that whcsoever would not come within three days. (Ib. 9.):
