the same manner as Esther is said to have sasted tltree days aad
three otplta, although the time of her fast did not last for seventy·
two hours, nor did it cousist of six parts of days and nights. On
the other handus it would be ιο uo purpose ιο cite the afore
said phrase of queen Esther, in order ιο determine the length of

her fast, and much less ιο prove that she went ιο the king only

seventy·two hours after the beginning of her fast, when the sense
of the phrase in question must, as the Scripture shows, be deter-
mined, as indeed it is, from other souroes; so likewise ιο no
purpose, does our learned opponent employ the words of Christ,
tltree days aad three oipltta, to determine the length of His stay in
the tomb and to show that the prophecy contained in these words,
would not have been fulfilled, if Christ had not remained seventy÷
two hours in the tomb. For if Christ, as Dr. Watson affirms, made
use of the aforesaid phrase ιο indicate the time He was to remain
in the tomb; since He knew how long He was to stay there, and in·
dicated it by a phrase which merely significa three days, without
determining whether they are to be considered complete and entire
or n0t; in order to know the exact time meant, we must have re
course to other means by which the truth may be learned and we
may be enabled to affirm unhesitatingly, what was the exact time
signified by the phrase three days aad three oiyltta Therefore, since
the meaning of the phrase in questionis by itself doubtful, it is
¹useless ιο employ it for the purpose of determining the length of
Christ's stay in the tomb.
