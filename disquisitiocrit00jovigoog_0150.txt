lamb is to be slain at 'the hour prescribed, but not roasled before
night, when the Sabbath had already passed and the first day of .
the week, the {ineman of Nisam had begun. This being admitted
as a ritual law, we maintain, that by this law the Jews wished to
anticipate the difficulty which might arise, whenever the four·
teenth day of Nisan should fall upon the Sabbath. Bm this
difficulty could not be anticipated and in fact the law expressly “
laid down could not have served its purpose, and would have
been a¹ matter of ridicule, if hythe words of Exodus and Deut-
eronomy quoted: l'hc foartecath os the mouth io rte ccaaiwp, we
were to understand the first vespers of that day. The worda
quoted must then siguify the second vespere ; and really if by the
jacuerant day iotha cacainp, we hold the first vespera to be
meant, aa our learned opponent holds, when the fourteenth day
would fall upon the sabbath, the lamb should be elain ¹and
masted towards sunset of the thirteenth; but this would bethe
day before tha Sabbath, not the Sabbath by reason of which that
law was enacted. ln such a supposition then, we are forced to
condemn as empty and meaningless the law, that should forestall
a difficulty that could never possibly occur. «
