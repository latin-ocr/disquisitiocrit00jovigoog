{aa to the meaning of Christ's words in Matt (xii 40), our
Qnswer may he seen (1-32.); the text of Lulre (xxiv. 21.)
ve propose to explain aller the other objections are disposed of.
lt remaius then for us to investigate the hours of Christ’s stay in
'the tomb and the precise time os resurrectiones also the theory
of the Sabbatha
97.-As regards ae laur of the baad, Dr. Watson says:
“Christ was buried precisely when the Sabbath was appearing
because we read in Luke (xxiii. 54.): And tte dabbath drea
oearss’ Tathis we answer that the text falls to prove the propo-
sition.; for-a) the Greek word ἐπέφωσκε, in this passage, does not
denote that the Sahbath was already begun, but that it was then
about to begin, including consequently some part of Friday. And
so, in truth, has John George Rosenmiiller rendered this passage,
translating the Greek: K ai od66ar0r ἐπέφωσκε by : And ille sabbath
aaa already acar at baad. Such also is the rendering of John
Maldonato‚ who in his commentary on this text says that the
phrase, tha dabbath drea naar, is equivalent to this other, tho Sab-
aaa aar approoohiay.-b) The women, afterOhrist’s interment (ih.
56), relaraiap prepared apices aad aromata Such an action
however would have been unlawful, had it been already the Sub
bath. Hence we must conclude, that while they were thus oocu-
pied the Sabbath was not yet begun‚and muchlena reasonably
could it be said to have begun at the time when Christ was en-
tombed.-c) But however this may be, it is retain that Luke
in his writings most studiously observes the chronological order

of events Now the words in question succeed the narration
