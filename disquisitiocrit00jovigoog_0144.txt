54.-1f the reader have carefully followed our learned oppo-
nent's proof, he cannot have failed to observa that, according to
the foregoing opinion, Christ is said to have been delivered up, to

have suffered, died, and to have been buried on the 14th dav of

Nisan, for the reason that the legal pasch of the Hebrews, which ἢ

He Himself celebrated, just before undergoing his sufferings,
occurred between suaset of the 13th and the beginning of the 14th
day. Consequently, if the paschal feast mentioned was celebrated
by the Jews between sumat of the 14th and the beginning of the
15th day, and not as our learned opponent maintains, Christ too,
on this day obsernd it; and therefore we must consider as done
on the 15th day those things, which our learned opponent
has deemed events of the 14th. But the Hebrews offered the
paschal sacrifice iu the early part of the 15th day of the
month of Nisam and this is proved from the fact, that the
testimonies gathered from the books of Exodus and Deuter-
onomy, cited in the preceding paragraph, must be understood
as having reference to the second vespers of the 14th day, a
construction our learned opponent does not wish to give them.
It follows then, that Christ celebrated the pasch, was afterwards
betrayed, suffered, died, and was buried on the 15th day. There
