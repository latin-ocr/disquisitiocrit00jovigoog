any other meaning.’' What has been said about the expression
“ μία redderet, found in St. Matthew, in the place indicated,
should be applied to the other three passages cited above, as they
oontain the same phrase. Therefore, the five passages objected
by our learned opponent, must necessarily be understood in

Now, these same passages are thus rendered in the English ver· ‚

both being soHaBeA(29.). Now, the first σαὸὅάτων in St. Mett.
(l. o.) is rendered in Syriae by sonassron, the others by seHaBon.
Resides, this same distinction is observed by the Persian and
Ethiopian interpreters. Hence we see, that the English transla-

controversy. Let us now compare the Greek text with the Syriae,
Persian, Ethiopian and English translations, in order to make the ’

matter apparent. Matt. (xxviii. 1.): Ὀψὲ δὲ raetorum τῇ {erpwa-
