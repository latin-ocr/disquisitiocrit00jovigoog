should express a meaning of the word ur which it does not ordi·

narily bear. Now that peculiar meaning of the word ω’, which

is not commonly apparent in it, is night—in Hebrew nb'b. This,
then, and no other is the addition to be made to the word. Since
then the only fonction of this affix is to evolve the proper, though
latent, meaning of the word nr, it follows that itis not to be con·
sidered separately and apart from the word nr, bot as rather

or day. The rule aa to the year is stated in express terms in the
Gem. Rosch Hasschana (2. 2. and 7. 2.) andin Gem. Nidda (48. ·
1.) : mv ntvn mm ‘tna ur, ene day in the year ia used ser tte year.
The rule as to the memb is plain from this, that Pentecost which
is therefore scarcely two months aster Easter, yet, because that
period forms a part of three different months,this length of time
