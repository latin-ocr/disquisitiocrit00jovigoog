'l'hesc repaire, begun by Herod, and iu which during his reign not
nrore than eight years were spent (δυο. Antiq., lib. xv„ cap. xi,
ἐξ 5. 6.), were continued until about the tenth year of the reign
of Nero, which corresponds to the sixty-third and ditty-fourth
years of the vulgar era (ibid. lib. xx„ cap. ix., ἓ 7., coll. § 5. et
cap.xi.§1.). Hence these fortysix years do not constitute the
period in which the temple was finished‚ but only indicate the
beginning of the work. But it was begun in the eighteenth year
of the reign of Herod, that is in the year in which Caesar went
for the second time into Syria, and which began with the mouth
Nisan of the year J. P. 4694. The following is the testimony of

Jcsephus concerning this matter (Antia, lib. xv„ cap. x., ἓ 3.);
