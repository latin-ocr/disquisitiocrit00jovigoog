the Scriptura. Dr. Jno. George Rosenmiiller, commenting on this
passage of St. Matt, writes as follows: “They asked for 0 sign
from above, but 0 sign was promised them from beneath, wia: the

resurrection, which 01 011 miracles was the greatest and most effi·

cacione. Ishall not set you free, says J esus, in the manner you

dasne, but Ι shall die,¹ and riso on the third day.’' The preaehing
of Jonas roused the Ninivites to do penanoe, not because the
prophet had remained in the fish's belly exactly three days and
three nights, neither moro nor less; but because, by an extraordi·
nary dispensatim, he came forth from it sound, though, naturally
speaking, he should have perished. Hence this twofold state of
Jonas, his supposed death, 001 his resurrection, was the Ι0180
which induced the Ninivitas to correct their evil ways. But
Christ designed‚ καθ’ αὑτὰ and direotly to give tho Jews in His
own person a sign, suoh as Jonas was to the Ninivites: For or
‚Ionas woa 0 cipe to 110 Ninivites: so rboll 110 Son 01 roco otro be 10
tto penerotion (Luke xi. 30). His own death 001 resurrection
were, therefore, 10 constitute the sign which, in the alleged testi-
mony 01 Μο11., Christ intended to afford καθ’ αὐτὰ 001 di-
reotly. What, therefore, we at first established remains unshakon:
to the effect, namely, that the time, 01 which there is question,
was declared by Christ only κατὰ σχέσιν, 001 accordingly, rnust

not be taken in the most literal sense.
