Christ met His death on the very first day of Azyms.” So far
Bochart'. We may add the authority of Tertullian, who speaking
against the Jews (chap. viii.) on the time during which Christ

was dead, writes& follows: “The Passion was consummatori on

the first day of Azyms, on which Moses had prescrihed that the ⁷ o

lamb should be slain in the evening with which the first day
began.''

tions, which, we are confident, will give a satisfactory solution to
the objections which might be brought against our last conclusion.
First observation. The filteenth day of Nisan was the first of

the seven days of Azyms: newertheless the abstinence from
leaven began in the evening of the fourteenth day, En (xii. 18.):
Pte first socoth, the fourtcanth day os tlte mouth io tlte evening, you
adoll eat Uoleaoeood dread until tho one aod tweotieth day io tlte
cornino. Hence the custom of counting in the fourteenth day also
with the days of Azyms: hence too the different modes of expres·
sion, making the days of Azyms now seven, now eight We read
antonna: “when rossus: ow rafim aa, ,araucas
orat the moen from your haeses, we are taught hy tradition, that
the first day isto be understood as the fourteenth.’' On leaven and
Azyms sect ii. (see Lightfoot, The Minister of the Temple, chap.
xii, sect. 11.). J osephus says the same thing, both in the passage
above quoted, and in book 11, chap. xv„ i 1: Ὅθεν εἰς μνήμην
