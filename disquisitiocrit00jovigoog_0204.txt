[ιε rac day of rte parasceue aad ac dabbath drew aa. The Greek
*Xt runs thus: Kal ἡμέρα ἢν παρασκευὴ, And aa day was
ιο parasceve. In the Syriae we find these words: warauuon
aRusroa (22), not waJauu aaaunrosllh), nor warauuon
»aassunroa (24.); that is, it was the day, which is called the
³araaccoa As regards this testimony it seems to us that we agree
with our opponent (num. 10, sect. 11.).-Fiahly,J0hn uses the
word Paraaceuc in two other passages besides (xix. 14.) of which
·.here is questiont-a) in chapter xix„ verse 31. he says: Επεὶ
ταρασκευὴ ἦν, Bccaasc r't aaa tlte paraccccc. The omission of the
article proves that the noun is taken here in the meaning of day3
for if it meant preparation, we should have Ἐπεὶ ἡ παρασκευὴ ἦν,
with the requlsloe addition of the words τοῦ πάσχα ar τοῦ σαββά-
του. Our opponent is therefore wrong when he adduces this tes·
many in proof of the falling of the Parrhal dabbath on Thars-
day (num 10, sect IL). But we shall speak at greater length of
this passage in the following chapter-b) This same word is
found in the 426 verse of tha same chapter. There indeed
Διὰ τὴν παρασκευὴν τῶν Ἰουδαίων, Because of tlte parasceve os rte
Jews, it donatos, aa the article shows, a preparation. But surely it
cannot mean the preparation sor tha Paach! Why so? Because,

when tha noun παρασκευὴ isused alono, its acceptation must he

decided according to the sense, iu which it is more unequivocally
and frequently used ; now this preparation r's sar tte Sabbata aad
