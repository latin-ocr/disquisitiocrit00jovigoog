after (ib. 34.) One os tlte soldiere ortt a spent opened Ha ride;-
after (Mark xv. 43.) Joseplr os Arimatheo, o noble courwellor . . . .
went in boldly to Pilato, ond beyyed tlte body os Jesus. Therefore,
even if it were true, that the words, rte third day, implied the space
of seventy·two honrs, since these hours made up the entire time
which elapsed between the death and resurrection of Christ, to
the exclusion, at the very least, of four honrs which intervened
between death and burial, there would remain only sixtyeight
hours. Hence, even though we should grant that the words
tlte third day signify the space of seventy·two hours, still the pas·
sages cited by Dr. Watson do not prove that Christ remained.
seventytwo hours in the tomb.

aa-Bur it cannot at all be granted that the words tlte tlrird
day signily three entire days. And in truth‚ according to the
common usage of language, a century, a year,a month,a day,
while yet incomplete,is used to siguify the first entire century,
year, month, or day. Thus we call the century in which we live
the nineteenth, although only eighteen hundred and seventy-four
years have elapsed. Thus too a Lustrum, an Olympiad, although
they embrace but four complete years, are used to signify the
space of five years, as mey be seen in Lucian, ovid and Varro.
Thus also we speak of the tertian and quartan severs, which how·
ever return periodically on the second or third day.

can scarcely conceive how it escaped our author’s attentionis

found in all languages, not excluding the Semitic. The following

passages from Holy Writ will bear ont this assertion. According
