was made up of a night aud a day: uot so the third. For the

ably however not the day following: for alte stood io tlte doner

signiiy not three entire days, nor days of twelve hours distinct
from the nights, nor, finally, three days consisting of six parts
(days and nights); but, on the contrary, three natural days,
