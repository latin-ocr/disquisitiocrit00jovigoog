lamb at any hour, contrary to the plain words of the law, Dent.
(xvi. 6.); Thou oholi immolate the phuae worm run :err iw the
euewiwq at the going down of the suo. R. Selomo, Kinchius and
Pomarius understand here by the two eveniwys, the whole after·
noon and the first part of the night, as if the sun by its setting
dividsd two evenings. But according to the teaching of Aben
Erre, the two evenings begin with sunset and cease at twilight, or
the first lighting of tapers, which interval of time contains, as he
wishes, one hour and one-third. For the two evenings the Ohal·
daeans have rt’wnwt ⁸2, Between two suaa. This Chaldaean phrase
is not unknown to the Talmudists. Thus we have in the Hiero·
solymite Talmud (Treat. Berachoth, chap. 1.): ntro ’saw tot 52
,annot anu phua aar] iwriwn nicona rr wa innan nr ru rinnau
:tibh itu, Au the time dwriwy which the foce os the Euat reddent, is
called Doy5 whew it hegiae to pole it ie called betwecwawrw3 whew
it doricas, cod it becomes ow high libe below, theo it is Niqht.
Something very similar is found 'in the Babylonian Talmud
(Treat. on the Sabbath, chap. ii. folio 34. b.): Two saiw are two
periodo os time during which the swa ohiwes oftw wocw, owe os which
wweurer woow, the other weorer suaset. This is two ewewiwqa . ..
Thus, therefore the Hebrews hed two evenings, both before sun-
set: one was nearer noon‚ the other nearer sunset. And between,
or rather within those two evenings‚ that is, within the space of
time which both embraced, there was slain, besides the paschal
lamb, the everlasting sacrifice, the lamps were lit and incense

burned‚ Ex. (xxix. 39. and xxx. 6.). The order in which these

things were severally done is thus given by theson of Maimon
