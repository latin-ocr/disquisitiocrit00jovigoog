reference to death, as will become manifest by citing all the pas
suges of the Sacred Text in which it occurs :-Matth.( . 8.)-
John (v. 21, xo. 1. 9. 17.)-A0a(1u.1'5.,rv.10.,v.ao.,x.4o.,
xiii. 37, xxvi. 8.)-Rom. (iv. 24, viii. 11, x. 9.)-1. Cor. (vi.
14, xv. 15.)—2. Cor. (i. 9., iv. 14.)—Gal(i. 1.)-Ephes. (i. 20.)
-Colos (ii 12.)-1. Thes. (i. 10)-Hebr.(xi.19.)-1. Peter (i.
21.). Moreover, that the words in question are used only in
reference to death, is manifest from the fact that when the Scrip .
ture would signify as well the act of leaving the tomb as the re
surrection itself, it employs some other expression. Thus we read
(John xi. 43.) that Christ called Lazarus in these words 2—Lor·
arua, come forth.

ill—From what has been said, it is clear that the words to riae

cyclo, to robe up, have reference to the union of sonl and body,

which takes place in the resurrection; while, on the other hand, the

other expressions have reference rather to the body alone. Hence
the indicatione of time implied in the words to rim cyclo, to raiae
ap, point to the time which elapsed from the separation of soul
and body to their reunion. Since this is the case, the three pas-
sages cited above must be read aa follows: lb mise apula the
third day from He death ,·-Ht'm becchet up ua third day from
Ha death;-He arose aquia tte third day from He death ,· and,
consequently, the phrase, oo tae third day, refers to the time which
elapsed between His death and resurrection. Now Christ was not
buried immediately after death; for aster (John xix. 31. 33.) rte
