CRITIOO-BIBLIGAL DISQUISITION. 14

κατὰΙ σχέσιν, and not necessarily in its strictest significance in the
testimony of Matt. already cited, and the simple statement of
this truth seriously undermines the position of our opponent, still,
that the subject under debate may be placed in a olearer light, we
will proceed next to inquire, what that thing is, the duration of
