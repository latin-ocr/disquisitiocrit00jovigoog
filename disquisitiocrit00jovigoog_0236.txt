A feast uhrah occurs just eyter dte Sabbath5 and in Ohagiga (chop.
ii.): rna :ayn arrh hun narn, A jerat aaut folla on tlte Para·
eecce os tlte Sobbath. Itis with justice then, that Aben Enra,
variting 011 Leviticae (ehap. xxiii. 4.) says: aar 'nohm nr nrum

Friday. So also the Τεσσαρεσκαιδειατῖται, who used to celebrate
the Pnach on the same days as thadeus, celebrated that feast on
any day of the week without exception And Philastrius (in'

his work on the Heresy concarning the festival of the Pasch),

expressly says: “They always keep the Posala, not on a Sunday,
but on Monday, Tuesday‚ Wednesday, Thursday or Friday.'’
Therefore the Jews of that time had notas yet changed the order
of the feast cf the new rocoa to prevent thePasch falling ona
day next to the Sabbath.
aa-The second and last objectionis taken from the feast of ,

Panassa which, in the year os Christ's Pession, according to the
belief of -all Christendom from the remotest antiquity, occurred
on Soodoy. Therefore, the first day of Azyms fell on Sotardoy
and not on Fridoy. We can adduce, by way of an offset to
the argument drawn from Pentecost' another one taken from
the festival of Palm Saodoy, and for this purpose we cite the
words of John (xii. 1. and 12. 1’3;); Jeaoa tlwreforo sis day'e
