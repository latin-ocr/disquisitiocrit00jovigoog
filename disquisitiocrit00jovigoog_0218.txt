it applied to no other festivals than those, which occurred in the
month Tisri‚ the seventh month in the sacred year, resembling
the sabbath, and devoted to rest after the harvest season and the
gathering of that year’s crops. For this reason Philo also (lib. de
Festis p. 1183) ascribes to this month the largest distribution of
feasts. There was no other month of the year, in which so many
festivals took place, as may be found rehearsed in the Chroni-
¹con commonly called the Alexandrian (p. 19.). In the New Tes-
tament‚ thesauram day is osten expressed by the word σαββάτων,
asin Matt. (xii. 1.) and Mark (i. 21.). The expression ταῖς σαβ-
βάσιν and ὀφέ σαββάτων are equivalent to ὀφέ σαββάτου. Agaln,
as nav sometimes stands for the whole week, the expression μία
¹ σαββάτων, found in the New Testament, is the same in meaning
as μία σαββάτου, Nasus rw, rte first day os tbc neck, in Gem.
Schabbath. (156,1.), and Nava: vn, in Gem. Maccoth. (5.1.),
Gem.Nederim.(12.1.). Moreover some writers are of opinion
that μία σαββατὼν was originally derived from the Hebrew prusa,
which asterwards passed into the Greek plural termination σαβ-
βάτων, in the same manner as χείμαρβαν τῶν κεόρῶν was formed
from the Hebrew pomp bnt, 1. Kings (xv. 13.), John (xviii. 1.).
Others however suppose the plural σάββατα so formed because of
its resembling the sound anwgor Syr.,scnrrr0s(26.), just as
in Horace (lib xi. sat. 9.), a single day is called lte thirtictb sab-

bats (in the plural); and Josephus, describing the entrance of ⁶
Ptolemy Lagus into Jerusalem (lib. xii. 1.) says: Ἐισελθὼσ γάρ
σαββάτοις εἰς τὴν πόλιν, Hacinp enimsi the clip οη ibe dabbath.

This expression he himself explains, (Antiq. iii. 10.): Ἕβδόμην
