feast of Azyma immediately before, or immediately after the
Sabbath. still, one must not suppose that by so doing, they
openly violate the Law; for they celebrate the Pasch at the pre·
scribed time. But in their calendar they se regulate the feasts by
the new moon that the festival days never immediately jein the

on Monday, Wednesday or Friday. We answer‚ that these ean·
