for the fourth time aster His baptism—Matt. (iii. 13.): Tbcn

His baptism took place in autumn of the twenty-fitth year of the
vulgar era, the fourth feast of Azyms after His baptism, during
which His death occurred, must have been in the twenty-ninth
year of the vulgar era. Indead Christ seems to have had refer·
ence to this in what He said in the parable of the barren figtree,
Lnke (xiii. 7. 8.): Bcboldsor tbcsc three years Ι conc sccldnq fruit

73.-Second argument When Christ after his baptism had
just come to the solemnity of the Pasch, and was addressing the
people of Jerusalem, He said to thern: Destroy wia tcmpb, ond
in three days Ι will raiae tt wp. rte Jews tlwre aoid: se ond forto
years was this tempto in buildiny, ond wilt tbow rotae w wp in three
days! (John ii, 19. 20). It is clear that this was said neither of
the temple built by Salomon, nor of that erected by Zorobabel; ·
for the building of neither of these required fortysix years. It

must therefore have been said regarding the alterations by

which King Herod gave to the temple a more stately form.
