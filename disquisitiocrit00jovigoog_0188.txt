72.-Τ1144 we may establish the first part of this thesis, let this
be the first argument—Christ was born on the twenty-fifth of
December in 4114 4707411 year of 4114 Julian Period, and this was
the seveuth year before the vulgar era. See Sanolemeutius (de
vulg. aerae emendat lib. iv. chap. 7.) aud Harduinus(antirrhet
de num. veter. populor. pp. 64. 65.).—He was baptized by John

in the Jordan when He was about thirty years of age, and this
thirtieth year He completed on the 25411 of December of the
year J. P. 4737, of the vulgar era the twenty fourth—When John
began his ministry‚ it was the listeenth year of 4114 rule of Tibe-
rius; not the liiteenth from the death of Augustus, but from the

time when Tiberius had reached equal power with Augustus over

the provinces—This year began for the Jews in the latter part
of the summer of the twenty-fifth year of the vulgar era See
Patrizi (Dissert. xxxix. of the work cited). Now Christ came · ’
to be baptized neither before nor· aster the autumn of this
year. Not before; for thus it would not have been in the listeenth
year of Tiberius: not asten for thus He would have already
completed his thirty-first year. But we gether from 4114 Gospel
that Christ was crucified when the Azyms were being celebrated
