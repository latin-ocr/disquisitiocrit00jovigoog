tlt-'next in order comes the biblical argument taken from the
words of John (xix. 14.) : And it was tlte paraseeve os tlte Posala,
about the sart dour, in which, contrary to whatour learned oppo-
nent (num. 9.) thinks, the first day of Azyms is intended. This
therefore is to be shown first ; and it is shown from this, that
παρασκευὴ is employed in the passage cited, to designate aa entire
day. For, as the Jews when using the Hebrew tongue, have
amplified numurus, so as to signify thereby the entre day of

AEla'day, so when using the Greek, they employ the word παρασκευὴν ,

to mean both the eoeainy lours of Fridoy and the whole os that
day. The first part we prove, first, froin the words of Mischna .

in this place, of three entire days, therefore not only of the latter
part of the day before the Sabbath, but of the entire aiath doy'
of the weeh-Seoondly, the Misohnioi in Pesaoh. (cap. v., ἓ 1.),
