ligea war. The word σαὸὅάτων has a double sense in the above
text; for in the first part tartara refers to the Sabbath day,
whereas in the latter it means a werlo. Wherefore the words, Ty
(ἡμέρᾳ) ἐπιφασκαὺαῃ εἰς μίαν σαὸὅάτων, for Ἐν μία tartara-2, are to
be rendered, At tlte down of ibe first day, or, at ibe broulo of tlte
first day os tlte werlo ,· for μία σαββάτων is tte first day of tte aaa,

however frequently employed to denote the dawn of day. There-

d) that further experimental proofs of this common signification
would be useless.

aa—In further confirmation of our argument we may quote
from John Maldouato‚ S. J„ who, in his comments on the above
passage from st. Matthew, thus speaks of the words ὈψὲΙ a aad·
σάτωνε “St. Gregory of Nyssaa Greek by lauguage and by
birth, reminds us that this phrase among the Greeks, properly
means, The dabbath beloy loay possed ; for the Greeks commonly

say: Ὀψὲ τοῦ καιροῦ παραγέγονας, Yon bove come later tlaa you
