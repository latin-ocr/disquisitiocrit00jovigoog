vesrsion in the modern languages published up to the present day,
agree with the ancient texts in regard to the aforesaid phrase.
And if the version of Luther is brought to bear against us, which
reads:u1rranrw nna nana, and that of F. Ostervald, who
translates it by: naus un sam na ns ranam we shall easily
make it appear that these confirm the meaning to be given to that
phrase.

12.-Alth0ugh from the constant agreement of the versione
cited, it may be rightly inferred that Ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ τῆς γῆς does
not mean a sepulchre, nevertheless, owing to the importance of
the matter, we perceive that this is not sufficient to place our eon·
’ clusion beyond the reach of our adversary’s weapon. We must,
therefore, proceed with our investigation and see, whether it may
not have been hy mere chance, that the uniformity of the above f

quoted versione has yielded such a fact ; or rather, as is really the

case,·that the phrase, ’Eo τῇ καρδίᾳ τῆς γῆς, is made up of ele

ments, which can in no wise mean a sepulchre.

13.-We hold then further, that it was not by chance that the
ancient versione agree in not giving to the aforesaid phrase the
meaning of sepulchre, but because, by its very nature, it was not
susceptible of such a meaning. And indeed the phrase, oon
nnana: (heart of the earth), which is of Semitie origin, was not ‘
invented to express a sepulchre; for con (heart), the principal
word of the phrase, whether it is considered by itself, or as
joined with the determining substantive unane (the earth),was
not intended to mean a sepulchre. And that thiais really the

case, we 'prove in the following manner: :ib or aeson (10)
