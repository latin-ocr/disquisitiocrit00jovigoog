'lh—Since we have already determined the death 01 Christos

having occurred in the twenty-ninth year of the vulgar era, asto
the day of the week on which this event took place, and this is
the second part of our position to he maintained, there can beno
doubt, if it he once made clear with what day 01 our months, the
twenty-fifth 01 Nisan coincided that year. For it is known that
the Jews counted their years, using the moon as a term of com·
parison, so that the first day of the month was that on which
the moon was in her first phase (φάσις). See Bucher. (De Doctr.
temp. cap. iii), Petav. (Doctr. temp. lib. iv, cap. 21), Auctar. Ι
(lib. ii, cc. 4. 5.), Fastor. (lib. iii, vv. 877. 878.,0011. 849- .
ssa), ne ue sust. (00. rx, ap. 14, us. xi, cap. a), aava
Thes. antiq. Rom. (t. viii, coll. 19. sequ). Moreover from Lar-
geteau's tahles, constructed according to the calculation 01 Syzy·
giae, the Pascha] moon in the twenty-niuth year 01 the vulgar era
was, at Paris on the 4th 01 March, at four minutes past one
o’clock, a. mon Friday. Therefore at Jerusalem it was on the
4th of March at fifieen minutes past three 0. m. on Friday.
For the meridien of Jerusalem differs from that 01 Paris by
32051'15'' E, and in time by 42 hours,11'2h''. But the fif·
teenth day of the mouth falls on the same day 01 the week as the
first: therefore, in the year 10 which Christ died the first day 01
Azyms was Friday. See Largeteau. (Connaissance des temps
pour 1846 Additions).'
