the disputed phrase, vir, ε Ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳτῆς γῆς thus: m vnn naam

were so translated from the Greek into the Syrien language, on
the plea that'the latter has no word expressive ol' sepulchre, we

three several ways, viz, as it occurs in Gen. (xxiii. 9.) naseos (2.)

the Ghurch. This also renders the words in question thus: 1w uns
