Testament of any· one's being in the beart of tbe earth, although
so many were actually in the sepulchre.

16.—This point being established, we thus argue: Since, on
the one hand, the boort of the earth does not mean a sepulchre,
and since, on the other, it is of saith that the place into which
the soul of Christ, united to His Divinity, deseended after His
death (which place, according to the Sacred Scriptures and the
holy Fathers‚ us we shall see, is in the uentre of the earth>,is
altogether a different place from the sepulchre, it follows that
Christ intended to denote that other place by the expression io tlte
beart of tlte earth. To this argument we may add another taken
from these words of the text under discussion: So eltoll tlte Son os

mon be. Since these words referto the three days during which

the Most iloly soul of Christ was separated from His body, they

cannot signify the whole Theandric composite, neither can they
denote His lifeless body, for that could not properly be called the
Son of man. Hence they must signify the seul, that is, the prin·
cipal and the nobler part of the human composite, which gives
’ to the body of man its substantial being. Now, the soul ol' Christ
was not during these three days in the Sepulchre but in the cen·
tre of the earth. Therefore this is the placeto which Christ al-
luded hythe words: io tlte heort os tlte carth. In the third place,
‹lesus Christ hythe words: rm Jonos wne in tlte whole’s bell . . . .
so stall tlte Soa os mun bc in tlte beart of tlte earth, institutes a
comparison: the terms therefore ought to correspond to each
other. Now, tho first part ol' this text speaks of Jonas who, ac·

cording to almost all interpretem, was alive in the whale's belly.
