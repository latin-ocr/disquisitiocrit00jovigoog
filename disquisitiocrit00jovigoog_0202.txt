ἐνάτης. Josephus Antiq. (lib. xvi, cap. vi, 5 2.). The word
ταρασκεοῇ, in this construction cannot possibly mean α prepara·
idom for the phrase reads, not τῇ ταύτης παρασκευῇ, but τῇ πρὸ
ταύτης besides ifit had the meaning of preparation, the words
ἀπὸ ὧρας ἐνάτης would have no subject of dependence or limita·
tion. Its real impert is, therefore, either the συσσίτια or the whole
of Phiday.-Seeondly‚ in this passage of St Matt: Ίῇ δὲ ἐπαύριον,
ἥτις ἐστὶν μετὰ τὴν παρασκευὴν, Aac illo aeti day, whicdjollowed ileo
parasceve (xxvii, 62.), the word παρασκευὴ denotes tlte aaa day
of the week, and is used as its appropriate term. Who, in fact,
would call the birth day ofour Lord, if this were to fall on Sun-
day: the next day, which follows tlte cce of Christ’s birth? We
should rather say with more simplieity aad clearness: the next
day which follows the Sabbath, especially if the Sabbath were one
of some great event, as was the παρασκευὴ in question. Therefore
this meaning is, beyond all doubt,t0 be given to the passage quoted
from St Matthew by our learned opponent (n. 10. towards the
end): Aac tlte cart day, which foldrwed Facta—Thirdly, St
Mark (xv. 42.) says: Ἐπεὶ ἦν παρασκευὴ, ὅ ἐστι προσάββατον, It was
the parasceve, aa is, tlte day delore lde Sabbata Here the term
προσάββατον is used asa synonym of παρασκευὴ, and necessarily
causes it to apply to the whole of the day, which is called

apradssssaroa—Fourthly, we read in st Luke (xxiii. 54.) : Aadr't
