second of the mouth. Further it is certain from John (xx. 26.)
that the time intervening between two Sabbatha, by us styled a
neck, was called by the Jews eiyltt days. Thus where St. Luke
(ix. 28.) has: atem ciphi days aflet, St. Matthew (xvii 1.) and '

literally signify. Το conclude, therefore,‘the words tlte third
day, in the three passages cited, do not signify the time of
aewenty-two hours.
