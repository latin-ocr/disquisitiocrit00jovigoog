in the tomb. But the Catholic Church, by commemorating
the death os Christ on Friday, and His Resurrection on

which, at first sight, might seem to lavor the doctrine of my
opponent. Second, I purpose to show that Christ died on
the first day of Azyms Third, we shall see that in the
year os Christ’s death this day was Friday. Finally, Ι
shall consider such matters as are subordinately connected

with the question already settled.
