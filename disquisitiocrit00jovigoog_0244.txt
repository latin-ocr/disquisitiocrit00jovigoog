where we have in Greek Τοῖς arctare. These were regarded as

doubly sacred.’² We answer, that whatever we may think of'this
theory of the Sabbatha, one thing is certain beyond all doubt,
namely, that it cannot be proved from the above cited text of
Matthew that two Sabbatha sometimes fall upon the same day3
for although thereiu the Greek ferm of the noun is in the
