one day and two rights were called three days und three
nights, and, to resume briefly what we have hitherto said, that .
Jesus, in the text in question, meant nothing else; as if he
said 2—As Jonas was for three days in the whale’s helly and yet
was kept alive, so alsu the Messiah will be for three days in
the bowels of the earth and yet will return to life. -
