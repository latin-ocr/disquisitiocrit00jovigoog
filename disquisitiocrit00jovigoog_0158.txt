ιο the mind of Dr. Watson, which Christ evidently did not do.
Wrongly, therefore, has he made use of these words of Christ
to prove the day of twelve hours. This applies also to the
wora from aa Acts: From tte racc tour os aa aas, which
were brought in to prove that the night of twelve hours begins

We shall state briefly what is to be thought of it. The'principle
was a'pplied byimllg indeed, but salceio. Therefore it proves
