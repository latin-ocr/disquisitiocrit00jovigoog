17.)‚ Mark (xiv. 12.) and Luke (xxii. 7.), that this Pasch was
prepared and solemnited 011 the first day of ¹Azyms. This was the

customary time with the Jews for celebrating the Pasch, as we
learn from the words of Mark: Oa tte first day os tbe awbaoewcd

breed, rubea tbcy <the Jews) sacrafleed tbc Paocb; nay, it had to
be done at that time, as Luke clearly asserta: Aac tbe (first) day
os tlte lbdcaoewed breed cama, oa abab dwaa ⁴necessary ibat tbe
pascit abmtld be killed. This was said to no purpose, if Christ an·
ticipated the usual time, for there was no necessity that it should
hedone in this wisc. What Christ said to the disciples is also to
the point, Matth. (xxvi 2.): You motu thot aflcr two dayaaboli bc
tlte pasch· to wit, for the J ews. In the same sense it is said in
Mark (xiv. 1.) : Now tlte feast of tte parcit aad qi tte Atyras was
cflcr two days. Therefore, since Christ celebrated the Pasch after
those two days, He celebrated it at the very time when the Paacbai
solemnity and the feast of the Aaywa were held by the Jews.
The following day, on which christ was delivered up and cruci·
fied, was solemn. Barabbas was accordingly set free, because it
was customary to release a prisoner upon the solemn day. So we
read in Matth. (xxvii. 15.)‚ Mark (xv. 6.)‚ Luke (xxiii. 17.)‚
John (xviii. 39.). Hence we gather a new argument That feast
which immediately followed the celebration of the ,Paret could

be no other than that of the Argum, concerning which Moses -

wrote, Lev. (xxiii. 5. et: Pte first manib, tlte fourteeatb day of tte
