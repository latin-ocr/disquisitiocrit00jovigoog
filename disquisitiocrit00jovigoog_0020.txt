· Ι may here remark three things 1-1. That for the matter
here proposed, especially in the second and third division5‚
l am chiefly indebted to the learned work of F. Francis X. ⁵
Patrizi entitled: eru Tuas ne Evnuourus: and at times l
have not thought it improper to use the very words of that
illustrious writer, both because Ι do not flatter myself that
Ι could have expressed his ideas more clearly and distinctly,
and because Ι am happy thus to bear witness to the rever-
ence Ι feel for the authority of one whom lam proud to
claim as my preceptor in Biblical studies—2. Ι cannot for-
bear taking this occasion of paying a grateful debt of jus·
tice to these of my brethren who have so kindly and cheer-
fully lent me their valuable time and labor, and have, in a
very brief period of time, clothed this treatise in its English
dress—3. Ι must say a word about the Scripture texts
which Ι have collated from various Oriental versions of the
Bible. The difficulty of obtaining types for the Oriental

languageS, other than the Hebrew, has forced me to the ,

expedient of sometimes giving the texts in a literal liatin

translation, where the argument is based upon the structure
of the sentence; at others of giving the words themselveS,
though in Roman letters, when the words themselves are
the point in consideration. ln both caseS, each text is
numbered with the Arabic numerals which are referred to
similar signs which will be found annexed to the original
‘texts in lithograph at the end of the Latin treatise.
